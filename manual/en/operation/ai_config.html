<TR>
<TD>does not know all hands</TD>
<TD> the ai doesn't know the hands of the other players, but tries to emulate than on the basis of the played cards
in the tricks, which it remembers.

<TR>
<TD>does not know all teams
</TD>
<TD> the ai doesn't know the teams of the other palyers at the start of the game.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD> Number of rememebered Tricks
</TD>
<TD> This value standa for the number of tricks, which the ai will remember. Cards in tricks older than this number, will be forgotten by the ai. Exceptions are special cards like Dollen, Swines, etc. (This cards will ahuman player normally remember much longer, too)

<TD>
With this algortihm the ai simulates for each valid card recursive a game, the other plqayer of this gmae will be emualted by slightly modified copies of the ai itself.

<TD> With this teh ai builds a tree of all possible tricks for this situation.

<TD>Gametree with heuristics
</TD>
<TD>
The same as gametree, but first tries the ai to use a heuristic for each trick.

<TD> For all values of the function to calculate the value of a hand above this the ai will make a annoucement.
